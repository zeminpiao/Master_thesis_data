From the separate dataset and the interlacing dataset, the following sub research questions should be done.

0. To validate the consistency of the dataset, we need firstly investigate on the performance difference of one element on single chip.
1. What is the performance difference between different chips? (Research on one element on different chips)
2. Could different elements be identified using the spectrum information?
3. How to recognize certain area with two metals interlacing with each other instead of another element?
4. What is an efficient way to calibrate raw value to value comparable with theoretical value?
5. What the characteristics of data on the edge between chips?
